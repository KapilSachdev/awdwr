Installation of all necessary dependencies from a fresh install of Ubuntu:
  
  ruby setup.rb # see comments if dependencies aren't met

Execution instructions:

  ruby makedepot.rb [VERSION] [restore] [RANGE]... [save] --work=dir --port=n

    "restore" - restore from snapshot before resuming execution

    "VERSION" specifies the Rails version to test.  Examples:
      edge
      _2.2.2_
      ~/git

    "RANGE" specifies a set of sections to execute.  Examples:
      6.2..6.5
      7.1-9.5
      16

    "save" - save snapshot after execution completes

    --work=dir: name of work directory to use (default: "work")

    --port=n: port number to use for the test (default: 3000)

  Output will be produced as makedepot.html.

Tests against makedepot.html can also be run separately:
